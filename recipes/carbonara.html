    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Spaghetti Carbonara is the shit and honestly mine looks better than the
      one in this picture. It takes like 30 min to make and uses like 5
      ingredients, so it's a great staple.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Quarter circumference - Spaghetti Noodles</li>
        <li>2 Eggs - 1 whole and 1 yolk</li>
        <li>1 oz - Grated parmesan</li>
        <li>1 oz - Grated romano</li>
        <li>2 Strips - Thick cut bacon</li>
        <li>Generous amount - Crushed black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice the bacon in to small pieces and place in pan (no oil). Set heat to medium/low and cook until done, flipping occasionally.</li>
        <li>While bacon is cooking, add water to a pot and start bringing to a boil.</li>
        <li>While bacon is cooking and water is reaching boil, add cheeses, egg, and black pepper to small bowl. Whisk with fork until incorporated.</li>
        <li>Water should be close to boiling at this point, add noodles once it is and cook to al dente.</li>
        <li>Bacon should also be close to done at this point. Once cooked, kill heat and let cool down. Once cooled, drain most of grease from pan.</li>
        <li>Once noodles are done, throw into bacon pan and pour sauce on top. Mix together with tongs. Keep it moving so that egg doesn't cook.</li>
        <li>Plate and serve!</li>
    </ol>
